Definitions of AGIEF experiments. All experiments can be repeated from these.
The experiments and terminology is explained below:

--- April 2017

We are comparing unsupervised algorithms by running a two stage experiment.

* Phase 1 = unsupervised algorithm on MNIST 
* Phase 2 = supervised algorithm (logistic regression) on the features produced by Phase 1

** Phase 1 unsupervised algorithms consist of: **

* mnist-ksparse
* mnist-online-ksparse-ph1
* mnist-online-ksparse-real
* mnist-quilted-gng

** Phase 2 - Logistic Regression stage consists of: **

* mnist-classify-features
